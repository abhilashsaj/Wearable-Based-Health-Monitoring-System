### Problem Statement 

A company XYZ has 100 employees working where it has provided each and every employee
with an android support wearable technology to monitor each and every one’s health. The
company’s major concern is the priority of the employees’ health. Now that the company has
executed the first half of their target by providing the employees with wearables. Now they
have to fulfil the second half of their target which would be creating an application to monitor
individually and to govern them as a group.
