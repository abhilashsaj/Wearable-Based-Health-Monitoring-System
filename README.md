### Problem Statement 

A company XYZ has 100 employees working where it has provided each and every employee
with an android support wearable technology to monitor each and every one’s health. The
company’s major concern is the priority of the employees’ health. Now that the company has
executed the first half of their target by providing the employees with wearables. Now they
have to fulfil the second half of their target which would be creating an application to monitor
individually and to govern them as a group.

#### TASKS

Have an IoT device or Open API deployed on server to gather the datasets for the health
impacting parameters like Body Temperature, Blood Pressure, Respiration, Glucose, Heart
Rate, Oxygen Saturation, Electro Cardiogram etc.

Any critical values in any one of the parameters is considered to be putting that particular
person is not health conscious. So, for monitoring purposes applications are needed.

Have a prediction model to find diseases from parameters so that precautions can be taken
beforehand.
